> *Turning pages into data points: An analytics tool to track, visualize, and understand reading habits.*

**About the Project:**
* Developed for the *Scripting Data Processing* course, this application serves as both a personal library database and an analytical tool. It allows users to track read and "to-read" books while providing deep insights into their literary journey through interactive visualizations.

**Key Features:**
* **Data Visualization:** Transforms raw data into accessible charts (reading pace, genre distribution, monthly stats) using **ggplot2**..
* **Persistent Database:** Uses **SQLite** to store and manage book entries efficiently.

**Tech Stack:**
* **Core & UI:** R, R Shiny, CSS
* **Data & Backend:** SQLite, Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)
* **Focus:** Data Analysis
* 🔗 **[View Repository](https://github.com/Retunse/Book-manager/)**
